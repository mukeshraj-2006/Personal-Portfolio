Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a modern, responsive showcase of my skills, projects, and professional achievements as a UI & Frontend Developer and AI/ML enthusiast.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Modern Aesthetic:** A sleek dark-themed design with a "Gold & Black" color palette (`#FFDB70` accent), fully responsive across all devices.
*   **Dynamic Navigation:** Single-page application (SPA) feel using vanilla JavaScript for smooth section transitions without page reloads.
*   **Interactive Elements:**
    *   **Custom Cursor:** A geometric gold arrow cursor that matches the site theme.
    *   **3D Hover Effects:** "What I'm Doing" service cards feature a subtle 3D tilt and lift animation.
    *   **Scroll Animations:** Timeline items in the Resume section reveal smoothly as you scroll.
*   **Project Showcase:** Dedicated section for projects with category filtering.
*   **Achievements Tracker:** specialized "Achievements" section (replacing the traditional blog) to highlight hackathon wins and finalist positions.
*   **Working Contact Form:** Integrated with [FormSubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co) for functional email delivery directly to my inbox.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Semantic markup for structure and accessibility.
*   **CSS3:** Custom properties (variables), Flexbox/Grid layouts, and CSS animations. No external frameworks (Bootstrap/Tailwind) were used, ensuring a lightweight footprint.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Vanilla JS for navigation logic, scroll observation, and interactive cursor effects.
*   **Ionicons:** High-quality vector icons for the UI.
